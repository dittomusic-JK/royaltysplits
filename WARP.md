# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ditto Music Services Tab - A Vue 3 + TypeScript application generated by Anima for configuring music distribution services across different subscription plans (Starter, Pro, Label, DittoPlusRLS).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # Type-check with vue-tsc, then build with Vite
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API (`<script setup>`)
- **Build**: Vite 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Ditto design tokens (CSS custom properties in `tailwind.css`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with vue-tsc

## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
App.vue                     # Plan selector tabs, renders ServicesTab
└── ServicesTab.vue         # Main services UI, orchestrates all service selections
    ├── SectionHeader.vue   # Section titles with descriptions
    ├── ServiceRow.vue      # Selectable service items (charts, pre-release)
    ├── FeatureCard.vue     # Toggleable feature cards with conditional pricing
    ├── CheckoutButton.vue  # Sticky checkout summary
    └── BeatportLabelModal.vue  # Multi-step modal for Beatport label management
        └── BeatportLabelDropdown.vue
```

### Key Patterns

- **Plan-based feature gating**: Components compute `includesX` based on the current `plan` prop to determine if features are included free or purchasable
- **Mutual exclusivity**: Charts selection has logic where selecting "Worldwide" deselects regional options and vice versa
- **Icon components**: SVG icons are Vue SFCs in `src/components/icons/`, exported via barrel file

### Type Definitions (`src/types.ts`)

- `Plan`: `'Starter' | 'Pro' | 'Label' | 'DittoPlusRLS'`
- `ServiceStatus`: `'available' | 'active' | 'unavailable'`
- `ModalStep`: `'select' | 'add' | 'upgrade'`

### Design Tokens

Ditto brand colors and typography are defined as CSS custom properties in `tailwind.css` and mapped in `tailwind.config.js`. Supports light/dark/active themes via `data-ditto-colors-light-dark-mode` attribute.

Custom fonts: Poppins (headings), Satoshi-Regular (body), Averta (loaded in index.html).
